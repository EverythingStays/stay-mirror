## stay-mirror

Mirrors npm modules recursively [soon] from source into IPFS, with one command.

The goal is to be able to take any npm module, run `stay-mirror $module` and it will mirror all the dependencies and the module itself.

## Usage

`./mirror-sh $MODULE $VERSION`

```

You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
state without impacting any branches by performing another checkout.

If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
do so (now or later) by using -b with the checkout command again. Example:

git checkout -b <new-branch-name>
